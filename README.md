# Linguistic and Embedding-Based Profiling of Texts Generated by Humans and Large Language Models

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the study of linguistic and embedding-based profiling of texts produced by human writers and large language models (LLMs). The project aims to investigate linguistic differences, stylometric features, and embedding representations to distinguish between human-written and machine-generated text.

## Research Objectives
- Analyze lexical, syntactic, and discourse-level features to identify distinguishing characteristics between human and LLM-generated texts.
- Use embedding-based approaches to map stylistic and semantic differences.
- Evaluate classification models to differentiate between the two types of text.

## Repository Structure
- Folder 'code' contains the .py for calculating each feature in our study.
- RAID_official.ipynb contains all the analysis and the visualization implemented in the study.

### Note: 
Due to file size constraints, the raid.csv dataset required for feature calculation is not included in the repository. To load it, run the initial code snippet in RAID_official.ipynb.
